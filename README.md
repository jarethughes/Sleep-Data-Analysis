# Sleep-Data-Analysis
Data Analysis of My Sleep Habits using SleepBot v3.2.8 for data collection and R v3.6.1 for data analysis. Scripts written in RStudio v1.2.1335

This requires two columns made to the right of the "Notes" column in the SleepBot .csv that is exported: "decST" and "decWT". These are created in Excel by converting Sleep Time (ST) or Wake Time (WT) to a number, and then multiplying by 24.
